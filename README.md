config
======

This repository is holds my config files and some scripts for setup of new
computers.  I got tired of always needing to create certain directories for
vim and set up git fields, etc., so I just put them all in one script.

Current setup capabilities:
  - Basic Editing
  - Python3 packages
  - GCC tools
  - Sun/Oracle Java
  - LaTeX and content generation
  - git configuration

Todo:
  - [ ] Have shell script accept args to specify which features to setup
  - [ ] Add keybase?
